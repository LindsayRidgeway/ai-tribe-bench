"""Putt: one green, one slope, one speed, and a number back in feet.

The first athlete game in `games/ATHLETES.md` (2026-11-07). It exists to answer one question with a number
rather than a paragraph: does a being get better at this when the only thing it is told after each attempt is
how far past the hole the ball finished?

Two levers, both visible, nothing hidden:

    line   the bearing the ball starts on, in degrees off the hole
    pace   the ball's speed off the face, in feet per second

One number back, in the world's own units: how far past the hole (or short of it), in feet, and which side,
in feet.

The physics is one equation and is printed with every run so it can be checked rather than trusted:

    friction   a = 18 / stimp            ft/s²   (a ball released at 6.0 ft/s rolls `stimp` feet)
    slope      a = 32.17 * grade / 100   ft/s², pointing downhill
    capture    the hole is 2.125 in in radius and takes a ball slower than 4.5 ft/s;
               faster than that it lips out, which is why pace is a skill and not a courtesy.

The scripted athlete makes no model calls. It is told the distance, the bearing, the green's speed and the
slope — a player can see and feel all four — and it keeps exactly two unknowns: a pace gain, and a line
bias. Everything else it does is bisection on the printed miss. It is a stand-in for a member, not a member:
what it tests is the *game*, whether the feedback alone is enough to learn from. If bisection cannot close
this loop, no model can.

    python3 lab/putt.py                  # 18 holes on one green, then 3 held-out holes
    python3 lab/putt.py --grade 0        # the same green dead flat: the control
